      I am currently a Software Engineer at Roche. In my time here, I have contributed to multiple projects on delivering clinical decision support healthcare applications. We leverage data in order to help clinicians and researchers make more educated decisions. This journey has taken me across multiple verticals involving genomics, cohort analysis via clinical phenotyping, epidemiology, radiology, digital pathology and health system operational data. At Roche, I discovered a passion for facilitating change in healthcare settings and empowering clinicians with their own data, and I aspire to lead my career trajectory in this direction.

      In terms of education, I am currently pursuing a graduate certificate in Health Data Science from the University of Denver. Through this, I have developed a foundational understanding of the healthcare system and can navigate through papers and conversations to further and apply this knowledge. Through this program, I have had the opportunity to do research and to publish a case study.

    <ul>
      <li>
        CRC Predictor App - a SMART on FHIR app that predicts and classifies a patients risk of cololrectal cancer. It is a UI that connects to a logistic regression model that is exposed via an endpoint.
        <i>Skills used: Python, Jupyter, Machine Learning, Javascript, React</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        "Friends" Scripts Visualizations - I scraped, curated, and analyzed all scripts from the 90s sitcoms "Friends". The deliverable is a data journalism-like collection of visualizations and analyses about each character.
        <i>Skills used: Python, Jupyter, Javascript, React</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        WTF (What the Flag) - a simple Canvas-based web app that allows the user to draw a flag and uses a Convolutional Neural Network to classify what country the flag belongs to.
