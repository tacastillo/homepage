		description: "In the summer after my Sophomore year of college, I took the initiative to learn modern web development on my own. \r\nImmersing myself with plenty of online resources, such as FreeCodeCamp, Youtube playlists and MOOCs, I gained a solid understanding of web development, its paradigms, and where I wanted to go with it. I moved into MEAN Stack development in conjunction with React.js and built various side projects to grasp and understand what web development actually was."

The end user would be able to search what they wanted to learn and filter through the results based on their specific learning style: Auditory, Visual or Kinesthetic. This app was deployed onto Heroku with its database hosted through mLab with Mongoose to maintain its schema."

Apttus is a Fortune Unicorn mid-sized start up that invented and pioneered the CPQ (Configure-Price-Quote) field. At Apttus, I was the primary UI developer for a large-scale revamp of one of the cornerstones  of our signature product. My experience resulted in exposure with Angular to the point of proficiency. My project was the vanguard for design changes and experimental features."
